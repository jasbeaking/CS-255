# CS-255
System Analysis & Design

# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
The DriverPass project aimed to tackle the problem of poor driving education, highlighted by the fact that more than 65% of people fail their DMV driving tests. Our client, DriverPass, wanted a complete system that combines online courses with live teaching to improve driver training. The objective was to create a better learning experience that would increase pass rates and produce more skilled drivers.

# What did you do particularly well?
____________________________________
During the course, I discovered that I was good at analyzing systems and visually representing complex ideas. The diagrams I made, including class diagrams, activity diagrams, sequence diagrams, and data flow diagrams, helped clarify the system's structure and function. This visual clarity improved my understanding and made it easier to communicate with my classmates and, hypothetically, stakeholders.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
If I could change one part of my work, it would be my UML class diagram. I documented the accessor methods well, but I see that the relationships between the classes need a more detailed approach. To improve the diagram, I would add more methods to show how the classes interact and depend on each other, giving a clearer picture of how these objects will meet users' needs.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Understanding user needs was key to my system design process. I started by creating diagrams that reflected how users might interact with the system. Using insights from sequence and activity diagrams, I could predict how each class would be used in real life. This focus on users is essential; without a clear grasp of their needs, the design may become too theoretical and not provide effective solutions to the problems it seeks to solve.

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
I have learned to value an iterative design method in software design. This lets me avoid getting stuck on details early on, which used to slow me down. Now, I use a cycle where each step improves on the previous one, gradually enhancing the design with new insights. I plan to keep developing this method, as it creates a more flexible and responsive design process.
